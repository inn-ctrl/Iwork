SELECT supplierid, sum(unitprice) as totbysup

SELECT pr.*,
row_number() over(partition by supplierid) as supplirperforms
FROM products pr
--with that you can get the best performing supplier
SELECT pr.*,
row_number() over(partition by supplierid order by unitprice desc) as supplirperforms
FROM products pr

-- we can use a sub query to get the best performing supplier across all
SELECT *

	SELECT pr.*,
	row_number() over(partition by supplierid order by unitprice desc) as supplierperforms
	FROM products pr
	) as supplierrank
WHERE supplierrank.supplierperforms = 1 --or WHERE supplierrank.supplierperforms < 2
--same can be used to make every filtering

--2. RANKING
--simply fetch top three suppliers overall using rank
-- the process is to simply rank all of them
-- and extract the top three performers


-- i will rank products based on suppliers by using revs
SELECT * 
FROM (
	SELECT pr.*, 
	RANK() over(partition by supplierid order by unitprice desc) as overallsupplierranks
	FROM products as pr
) AS rankedsups
WHERE rankedsups.overallsupplierranks < 3
--note: rank will give same rank to duplicate values
--note: row_number works like rank but it will never give same values to duplicates. it only
--counts row's occurance

---3. dense_rank: it works like rank but does not skip repeating values

-- 4. LEAD and LAG
-- 4.1. LAG -- compares a row with previous value
-- lag allw us to fetch data across rows without having to join
--e.g: check if the price of the prod. is higher, equal, or lower
--to the previous one
SELECT pr.*,
lag(unitprice) over (partition by supplierid order by productname) as prev_value
FROM products pr
--the first value is null due to lack of prev.
-- lag can take three arguments: 
-- lag(unitprice, 2, 0) unitprice means the current value, 
-- 2 means 'jump two places before' and 0 means defalt value (at indez 0 or the first in this case)
